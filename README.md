# Sorting-Packages-in-a-Factory
This project is about a system in a factory that allows the packages to be sorted according to their sizes and stacked in containers ready to be shipped. The types used are LinkedList, Stack, and many other methods that facilitate the system. The concept of using stacks in this project is to store the packages in the containers.
Packages are put in random sizes in a linked list from sizes 1 to 5. After that, the Packages are separated according to their size and put in containers. For example, if the packages are of size 1, they are placed in container 1, if the packages are of size 2, they are placed in container 2, and so on.
We can imagine that the container is a stack.
